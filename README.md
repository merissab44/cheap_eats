# A web app to check for food discounts in your area!

As college students, it's important that we are nourishing our bodies consistently. This is difficult because we often have to deal with other stressors such as tuition and living cost. This causes us to leave food on the back burner. We deserve to eat good and affordable meals!

This is where cheap eats come in!

Our app is designed for college students by college students to help you find local cheap restaurants in your area. 
Using the **YELP API**, we have filtered all restaurants by the cheapest with ratings above 3.5. 

**HOW TO USE CHEAP EATS**
Once a user logs in, they are brought to our homepage where they can browse all the restaurants near them. They can click on each card and will then be brought to a detail page where they can then see reviews, rating, and the address/hours of the restaurant.

**WHAT'S NEXT FOR CHEAP EATS?**

We are currently fixing our locator so that users all over will be able to enter their location and find restaurants near them. We also would like to enter into some collaborations with local restaurants that would be willing to give local discounts to their college students. Lastly, we understand that eating out everyday can also be pricy no matter how cheap it is so we want to have other options for discounts at local grocery stores. 

Happ Eating!
